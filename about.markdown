I'm currently studying different ways through which computers can better understand our world and therefore help us solve problem more efficiently.
These include but not limited to computer programming particularly functional programming. I especially like [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). Recently I've gotten into
dependently typed functional languages for instance [agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php).

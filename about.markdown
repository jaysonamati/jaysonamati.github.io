I'm currently exploring different ways through which computers can better understand our world and therefore help us solve problem more efficiently.
These include but not limited to computer programming particularly functional programming.

I especially like [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). Recently I've gotten into
dependently typed functional languages for instance [agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php). I'm using these systems to express mathematical ideas
in a formal manner.

I study Category theory, homotopy type theory, logic and dynamical systems. I'm interested in applying category theory and functional programming to
help solve problems in the real.

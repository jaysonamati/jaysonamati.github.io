The following post starts with a question, like all good conversations do.
How can we humans best realize the world? This question could have lot's of answers, ranging from
the metaphysical to the religious to simply being. Now as you can tell from the title of the post
this will somehow involve some mathematics. Well, you are right. This is somewhat an attempt to convince you
and perhaps also me of why we use mathematics to get a grip on the realness of the world.

Now we have to make sure we're on the same page about what we consider to be real, this question has could have
easily elude even the most awakened minds, since what is most real changes all the time. The changes in the human
mind perceiving the world change what they find salient and hence what grounds them the most to reality, the changing
environment also induces different criteria of filtering out what is real, the environment obviously includes other people
and this makes the situation even more complex. There could be many 'understandings' of what is meant by the word real, for
this post in particular we'll consider what is real as what one can realize in the world. What does this word realize mean?
You may ask, and I'm not sure I can give a satisfactory answer to you but I'll go with what seems pertinent to the question at
hand. Realizing simply put is what one can conjure in the phenomenal world. That sense of the word might seem out of place
considering we might be discussing mathematics, bear with me (help!).

Mathematics at first glance might seem like the most abstract subject in the universe as we humans know it and most of the time that
intuition is right. We want you to leave that sense behind and consider mathematics only as a language. What is language? That is
another question that has baffled many philosophers of the past and also current ones. We might have shifted the responsibility of
deciphering what is going on with language to computers in recent times but it is a question worth the quest of finding an
answer. For the sake of this post we'll take the functional definition of language, it is a tool, a psycho-tool that helps minds
communicate. Another question naturally arises from this, what is to communicate. The full consideration of this question is saved for
perhaps a later post specially designed to answer but for now, we'll take the dictionary meaning of the word, that is lazy but we need to
find a 'base' case for our argument and that seems like a good starting or ending point, depending on how you see it. Communicate: (according
to the online Merriam-Webster dictionary) to convey knowledge of or information about. Whoa! that's loaded. We now have the terms knowledge and
information, looks like our bottom was false after all. Don't fret though, there is a *way* out of this.

The Greeks as many in the west know came up with most words we use to describe our world today, particularly using the English language. So we are going
to consult the ideas (well according to our historians) they had when they crafted the word knowledge. We are not going to unravel the meaning of
the word knowledge and simply point the reader to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) article. Considering the word information, we
especially like an idea put forth by David Spivak and Brendan Fong in their book "An Invitation to Applied Category Theory", they simply sliced the word
into in and formation and used it in the context of data. As they put it "Data becomes information when it is stored in a given formation". I find it
rather neat. That is the grip we choose to have regarding the concept of information, now we are not at the 'bottom' yet regarding this idea since we have
introduced the concept of data.Defining this has a real danger of putting us into a conundrum, consider the dictionary meaning, factual information (such
as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation. See, we get information again, admittedly using the dictionary is
a good ingredient for ending up in circular reasoning land. So we are going to leave it at the information stage. If you are reading this on a computing
device we'll assume (very dangerous btw) that you have some intuition of the word data and we'll go with that.

The above endeavor was suitable to highlight why we need mathematics to communicate clearly and well. In math (at least proof based mathematics)
everything is properly defined and any new information is derived from basic axioms that all mathematicians in a certain field agree on. You can think of
the axioms as rules of the game. This is one of the reasons why mathematics as a tool for communication leads to clear understanding of the subject matter
being discussed. Okay! yeah using the word clear might be misleading but you get the point (I hope you do). Everything in a sense is properly defined and
as such there is no ambiguity, what one means is clear from the context and the statements and proofs they put forward. This is particularly useful in
formal mathematics where one relies on a computer to check that indeed what they claim and show are indeed correct, computers are really dumb and as such
one needs to define in detail and rigor what one wants or has. As we say earlier that language is a tool for communication and as we have argued (at
least tried) above that mathematics is suited for clear communication (even with computers) we can therefore conclude that mathematics is a language.

Looking at the current trends of misinformation around the globe, it seems to us that part of this is the lack of good communication between different
members of the human species and we think mathematics and tools derived from results can play a role (Maybe crucial) in fostering better communication and
understanding between people and groups of people. In a way this makes the world more real, more truthful since what is happening, what we can feel, what
we can sense is coupled with who we are and what we want to see prevail in the world, it brings meaning to everything. My claim is: Mathematics realizes
the world. And this blog is part of the pursuit to show that is the case.

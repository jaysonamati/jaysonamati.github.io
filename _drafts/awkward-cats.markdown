Having tried to construct a categorical representation of various phenomena in the world, one comes to notice that it is rather finicky when doing this for
every day "objects" such as doors, groceries, vehicles, etc. This is when compared to doing a similar process to mathematical "objects" such as graphs, groups,
topological spaces etc; which is a much "easier" exercise.

In this post we try to tease out why we think this happens. :

- everyday(Real) objects are very complex and have many facets each of which can be validly represented as a category but that category would just be an
  approximation of the actual object.
- mathematical structures are precisely described and have been subject of study for decades (at least some of them) therefore describing them with yet another
  mathematical structure is kind of (a long winded explanation of how sometimes it is hard to describe some nuanced structures) straightforward.
- Category theory was developed precisely to represent mathematical object and nothing else?(Just a nasty case of using the wrong tool for the job)
- Some examples of trying to categorify everyday phenomena e.g food...
- Some example of doing the same with some of our favourite mathematical objects.
